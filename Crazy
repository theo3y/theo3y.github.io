Crazy is the new criminal: 

The definition of mental illness is an inability to function outwardly. It is a misalignment between your brain, how it wants to and unconsciously forces you to interact with the world, and the way the broader societal scene wants the ill-person to interact with it. 

Crazy is neuro-divergent. Society was not designed for neuro-divergence. Society was designed by those personally organized enough - whether mentally, physically, socially or both - to fit within the world they create. The persecution of the mentally ill is an unconscious drive to maintain a stable atmosphere. It comes a form of security-logic ingrained  in superstructures, structures that have snowballed into a place of power where they can respond with force, repression of rights, whatever they deem necessary. 

Crazy is the new evil: 

Today, law-enforcement agencies are approaching the victims of mental-health troubles with the same fear that once gripped them from the threat of potential Middle-Eastern enemy operatives. A threat assumed, subdued by any means, then handled in the PR ring is better than any deviation from absolute peace and quiet, any disruption.
