The argument for nationalism, specifically, Scottish independence. 
Itâ€™s very simple. Pride is worth more than money. Those who sit in the lands of the wealthy in the United Kingdom can say with ease that Scotland should vote to keep the economic stability of urban and suburban in place, because to them, quality of life comes from their ability to move within the global economy. More jobs equals more prosperity, greater linkage with Great Britain means lower tariffs and more profit from exports, more access. But what about a percentage of the population who would rather live with pride, solidarity with their kin, and joy in their history instead of bitterness and defeat? 
This is not an alignment with either side, but we as citizens of the world should see every side.
