google presents the conundrum of search specificity. For those that do not think in or have not been versed in the proper ways to search google precisely enough to find the information they might be looking for, accessing well-founded information to complex questions can become dissuasively difficult. It has become a morass of misinformation rather than a path to development. 

In other words, even though google is the designated place to search in, the search process is more complicated than is useful, and frequently wastes people's time.**

Exploration for exploration's sake is where this assertion does not hold true. It is one of the great pleasure's of life to find something when one is not looking for it, and for this, google is fantastic at lighting the way. 

I also have a few theories: the search giant doesn't understand people beyond how they tap into algorithms. It understands words, wants, complex algorithmic relationships, everything but core human traits, the most important of which are the desires for simplicity, directness, and trust. Additionally, the advertising space sold which hopefully began as a way for google to fund its other projects, now Alphabet, has muddied google's ability to inform in a useful way. 

We want to be able to use a search engine that is willing to understand us without posing the threat to the curious that their souls are going to be sold to the government or anyone who might want to twist money out of them.

**You might not know how to phrase your question. You might click on an outdated answer. You might have to call your granddaughter because she's better with technology, but she might have a version of chrome that you don't, or she might be in class. You might not have a granddaughter. And then you might have to pay someone way too much money just to do something as simple as open your email. 
ex: For example, if you have more than one email address and you forget the password to one, try to reset it, and get denied because google 'cannot confirm the email belongs to you.'
