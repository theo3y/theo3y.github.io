The argument for nationalism, specifically, Scottish independence. 
It’s very simple. Sometimes, pride is worth more than money. 
Those who sit in the lands of the wealthy in the United Kingdom can say with ease that Scotland should vote to keep the economic stability of urban and suburban in place, because to them, quality of life comes from their ability to move within the global economy. More trade equals more prosperity, greater linkage with Great Britain means lower tariffs and more profit from exports, more access. 
But what about a percentage of the population who would rather live with pride, solidarity with their kin, and joy in their history instead of bitterness and defeat? Often, the fear of losing personal, regional, and national identity holds more water than the chance to exist at the fringes of a modernizing society - it is a gut resistance against sacrificing the past when the validity of submitting to what can seem like a benevolent, malificent future is in question.
