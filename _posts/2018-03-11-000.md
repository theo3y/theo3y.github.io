**I am sorry, my brother. 
The shackles bind my hands 
And iron is circling the place where I sleep. 

I am sorry, my brother, 
That I cannot help the elderly or the widow or the little child. 

Do not weigh the death of a man as a sign of defeat. 
The only shame is in betraying your ideals 
And failing to stand by your beliefs.**
